Wellcome to the future!

## 2. Features
### 2.1 The WebPage
A Webpage where Customers can buy all sortes of clothes/shoes in various sizes/colors. There is a search and filter function making it so much easier! There is also a paginator in the bottomw of the page making it so much easier to view our items. The Previous/Next button wont work if there isnt any more products to see. 

Note: The storage unit where we keep our products is rather small so we have a limited amount of products in right now. But in a year or two, our salesmanager "Andy", estimates we will be bigger than Amazon. So better join now before we start demanding a monthly fee for free shipping.

### 2.2 Transactions
All transactions are handled through PayPal in a secure way. Just buy an item and you´ll see! We even make it easier for you the next time you purchase something because your shipment details will be stored! So now you just have to click on the "confirm transaction" button and its done! To make you feel safe and secure we even send you a confirmation mail that the transactions has be done. So be sure to keep and eye on your inbox.

### 2.3 Cart
If you have a low income you can always come back and your items will be stored in your cart. However, if the items you want are popular and we run out of stock thats a "YOU" problem. You wont be able to buy these items anymore (but for the right price...)
What else is there...If you find something you really like you can always increase the number of items you want within your cart. You can even remove items but we dont recommend it.

### 2.4 Register
All of our Customers are welcome to register to our site. We just need your shipping details, a email we can communicate through and a unique password which you want to keep for yourself. If you are like "Andy" though and keep on forgetting stuff you can always reset your password by providing the mail you registered with. In less than a second you´ll be able to create a new on through the mail we sent you. Be sure when creating a new password to remember it because you need to confirm it. Be sure to write the same word in both places otherwise it wont go through.

### 2.5 Dashboard
When registered you will have your very own dashboard. Here you can edit your profile and even upload a picture of yourself to show all your new iShop friends! 
You will be able to see all you orders through "My Orders" and If you wanna dive deeper you can even click on them to get specifics!
