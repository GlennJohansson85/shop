# 1. iShop

A ecommerce project 

## 2. Features

1.a) A Webpage where Customers can buy all sortes of clothes/shoes in various sizes/colors. There is a search and filter function making it so much easier! 

Note: The storage unit where we keep our products is rather small so we have a limited amount of products in right now. But in a year or two, our salesmanager "Andy", estimates we will be bigger than Amazon. So better join now before we start demanding a monthly fee for free shipping.

2.  All transactions are handled through PayPal in a secure way. Just buy an item and you´ll see! We even make it easier for you the next time you purchase something because your shipment details will be stored! So now you just have to click on the "confirm transaction" button and its done! To make you feel safe and secure we even send you a confirmation mail that the transactions has be done. So  be sure to keep and eye on your inbox.

Note: If you have a low income you can always come back and your items will be stored in your cart. However, if the items you want are popular and we run out of stock thats a "YOU" problem. You wont be able to buy these items anymore (but for the price...)

3. What else is there...If you find something you really like you can always increase the number of items you want within your cart. You can even remove items but we dont recommend it.

4. All of our Customers are welcome to register to our site. We just need your shipping details, a email we can communicate through and a unique password which you want to keep for yourself. If you are like "Andy" though and keep on forgetting important stuff you can always reset your password by providing the mail you registered with. In less than a second you´ll be able to create a new on through the mail we sent you. Be sure when creating a new password to remember it because you need to confirm it. Be sure to write the same word in both places otherwise it wont go through.

5. All Customers will have their own dashboard, where they can edit their profile (in the areas mentioned above).
    - If our members have a tendency to forget things: No worries, all orders will be stored in their dashboard in a organised way. By pressing an order they will be  
      directed to the specific order details for that order. Neat!
    - And if our dear friends forget their signin details: No big deal, just submit your mail and in couple of seconds you will be able to create a new one through    
      the reset password mail we sent you. 
    -
    -  and recieve a reset password mail. Here are checks so the user must type their new password twice to confirm it. iF its a missmatch they will be alerted.
